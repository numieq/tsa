# Numerical Integral Equations for Time Series Analysis
## Motivation
Time series analysis is used in many fields, including finance, economics, engineering, social sciences, and natural sciences. It can be used to forecast future values of the data, estimate the impact of various factors on the data, and identify anomalies or outliers in the data.

The common statistical techniques which are employed for performing the analysis, are, among others, moving averages, autoregressive models and their extensions (e.g., ARIMA, SARIMA), exponential smoothing, and noise filtering . These methods rely on the assumption of some form of ergodicity or stationarity combined with either Gaussian noise or Markovian randomness. Hence, are limited to these constrained. 

The goal of this repository is to provied theory and methods for handling non-stationary and non-Gaussian heavy tailed noise time series from integral equations point of view. 

## Topics
Not all topics of time series analysis are treated here. The focus of this work is on the following topics:
  * Elements of Covariance theory.
  * Generalized Linear estimation.
  * Non-linear estimation techniques.

Our derivation of estimation methods is done in the framework of covariance theory, with minimal a-priori assumptions about the underlying distribution laws.
